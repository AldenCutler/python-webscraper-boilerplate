# python-webscraper-boilerplate

Using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, I created this basic webscraper boilerplate. To use it, replace URL in html_doc = requests.get('URL').text with any URL you want to scrape data from. You can then use any of BeautifulSoup's many features to filter through the HTML.
